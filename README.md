Reflective Statement

Over the course of this subject, I’ve undergone a significant shift in how I conceive of writing—not simply as the arrangement of words on a page, but as an encounter with form, medium, and interaction. My final creative work, a psychological narrative constructed in Twine (using the Harlowe story format), reflects an ongoing experiment in storytelling that privileges unease, ambiguity, and reader entanglement. What began as a tentative exploration of digital writing has become a practice that embraces structure as malleable and meaning as co-produced.

I came into this course confident in my prose but unfamiliar with the technical frameworks that shape digital writing environments. Early class discussions around “what even is software development and coding?” challenged me to step beyond the safety of static documents. Harlowe’s limitations and possibilities became productive constraints—I wasn’t just writing a story, I was designing a system of reader interaction, of progression, of decay. This tension between control and surrender was central to the piece I created. Rather than constructing a fixed narrative, I focused on tone, voice, and formal slippages—elements that could be subtly manipulated through CSS and macro logic. The result is a work that draws attention to its own formatting, fragility, and interface.

A key learning moment came when I began to think in terms of “readers” not as passive consumers but as participants. How could I guide someone through a narrative where the expected markers of genre, progression, or even authorial clarity were under threat? What role does repetition play when the text loops but shifts? These questions arose as I wrestled with ideas of impermanence and digital entropy—recurring themes in the course that resonated with my own interests in psychological fragmentation and identity. Interactive fiction, I discovered, is particularly suited to embodying this. What we create online is always provisional: revisable, linkable, prone to glitch. These qualities became part of the narrative logic.

Peer workshops, classroom discussions and further investigation into the repositories of older work were also central to my growth. Seeing concrete poetry pushed to visual extremes, and some haunting chatbot-style texts, encouraged me to embrace digital writing not as a derivative form of analogue writing, but as its own evolving space. I borrowed from this ethos in my interface design, attempting to reflect the claustrophobic tone of the story through visual compression and restrained color. Even decisions as minor as click delays or fading transitions became expressive tools.

Ultimately, even if I haven't discovered a hidden love for writing code, this course has taught me to think of writing as architecture—shaped by tools, nested in layers, responsive to interaction. More than that, it has challenged me to relinquish total control. The reader brings uncertainty into the work, and that uncertainty is generative. My final piece doesn’t just live in a browser—it depends on it. And I’m now much more interested in where that threshold between author and interface might be pushed next.
