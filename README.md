Reflective Statement

Over the course of this subject, I’ve undergone a significant shift in how I conceive of writing—not simply as the arrangement of words on a page, but as an encounter with form, medium, and interaction. My final creative work, a psychological narrative constructed in Twine (using the Harlowe story format), reflects an ongoing experiment in storytelling that privileges unease, ambiguity, and reader entanglement. What began as a tentative exploration of digital writing has become a practice that embraces structure as malleable and meaning as co-produced.

I came into this course confident in my prose but unfamiliar with the technical frameworks that shape digital writing environments. Early class discussions around “what even is software development and coding?” challenged me to step beyond the safety of static documents. Harlowe’s limitations and possibilities became productive constraints—I wasn’t just writing a story, I was designing a system of reader interaction, of progression, of decay. This tension between control and surrender was central to the piece I created. Rather than constructing a fixed narrative, I focused on tone, voice, and formal slippages—elements that could be subtly manipulated through CSS and macro logic. The result is a work that draws attention to its own formatting, fragility, and interface.

A key learning moment came when I began to think in terms of “readers” not as passive consumers but as participants. How could I guide someone through a narrative where the expected markers of genre, progression, or even authorial clarity were under threat? What role does repetition play when the text loops but shifts? These questions arose as I wrestled with ideas of impermanence and digital entropy—recurring themes in the course that resonated with my own interests in psychological fragmentation and identity. Interactive fiction, I discovered, is particularly suited to embodying this. What we create online is always provisional: revisable, linkable, prone to glitch. These qualities became part of the narrative logic.

Peer workshops, classroom discussions and further investigation into the repositories of older work were also central to my growth. Seeing concrete poetry pushed to visual extremes, and some haunting chatbot-style texts, encouraged me to embrace digital writing not as a derivative form of analogue writing, but as its own evolving space. I borrowed from this ethos in my interface design, attempting to reflect the claustrophobic tone of the story through visual compression and restrained color. Even decisions as minor as click delays or fading transitions became expressive tools.

Ultimately, even if I haven't discovered a hidden love for writing code, this course has taught me to think of writing as architecture—shaped by tools, nested in layers, responsive to interaction. More than that, it has challenged me to relinquish total control. The reader brings uncertainty into the work, and that uncertainty is generative. My final piece doesn’t just live in a browser—it depends on it. And I’m now much more interested in where that threshold between author and interface might be pushed next.

Hayles, N. K. (2007). Electronic Literature: What Is It? The Electronic Literature Organization. https://eliterature.org/pad/elp.html

This is the first thing I'm reading for this class and I’m kind of overwhelmed, I really was unsure what to expect. I didn’t even know “electronic literature” was a thing, I've inadvertently experience some before, but would never have thought of it in this way. I came in assuming it was stuff like text-based games or hypertext fiction, maybe visual poetry with code? But then Berens throws in memes, hashtags, and Instagram poetry as things we might need to include in the category, and suddenly the whole concept gets way more complicated (and interesting).

The gardening metaphor really stuck with me. A walled garden — curated, neat, exclusive — versus permaculture, which lets things grow wild and supports itself. That shift made something click: traditional e-lit is like this niche, academic zone with its own values and expectations (difficulty, code, high modernist vibes), but there’s this massive world of people making weird, literary-ish things online who don’t even know what “e-lit” is. And that’s kind of where I feel like I sit. My Twine project was born out of experimentation and vibe, not theory or tradition.

Berens talks about how just inviting people in isn’t enough — that “inclusion” isn’t the same as decolonizing. That hit hard. The idea that you can’t just add marginalised work into an existing structure and call the job done — yeah, that resonates. Makes me think of how many barriers are still quietly there even when people say they’re being open.

I’m still figuring out what counts as e-lit, but maybe that’s the point. It seems like everyone’s figuring it out. Which is exciting and weirdly liberating.



Berens, K. I. (2020). Decolonize’ E-Literature? On Weeding the E-Lit Garden. Emergent digital literary network. https://doi.org/10.7273/SVQQ-AB68

Okay, wow — this reading was a lot to take in, especially coming into it without a clear idea of what electronic literature even is. I’d never really thought about memes or Instagram poetry as “literature,” let alone something that might be part of an academic field. I always thought e-lit meant, like, weird experimental stuff made with code — and I guess that’s partly what Berens is saying too, but also challenging?

The gardening metaphor really helped me get it. The idea that traditional e-lit is like a “walled garden” — neat, curated, kind of exclusive — makes sense. And then the idea of “permaculture” as this messier, more organic ecosystem feels like a better way to think about all the random, chaotic, but meaningful stuff people are making online now. Like, even if someone doesn’t mean to make “literature,” does that mean it’s not?

It’s weird to think that something like a hashtag or meme could be e-lit, but I guess if it’s doing cultural work — like #BLM stuff — then yeah, maybe it is. I kept wondering where my own Twine project fits. I’m definitely not in the “prestige” camp, and I didn’t know about e-lit before this class, but I still felt like I was trying to make something literary… just with new tools.

The bit about decolonization vs. just “inviting people in” stuck with me. Inclusion isn’t the same as actually changing the system, and I guess that’s something the e-lit community is still figuring out. This reading made me realize how much e-lit has grown into a proper academic field — and how maybe that’s both a good and bad thing?


Rosario, G. di. (2021). The Origins of Electronic Literature: An Overview. Bloomsbury Publishing. https://doi.org/10.5040/9781501363474.ch-001

This chapter gives a surprisingly expansive sense of the timeline of electronic literature — much longer and more global than I expected. I hadn’t realised people were experimenting with computational texts as far back as the 1950s, and that those early works were already trying to make use of randomness and logic in ways that were considered literary. The Theo Lutz and Christopher Strachey examples both push against the idea that literature is necessarily authored in the traditional sense — they're generated by machines, but still framed as aesthetic texts. There’s something interesting (and maybe a bit unsettling) about that shift in authority from human to program, even that early on.

It’s clear that the history of e-lit isn’t neatly linear or geographically centralised. There’s a lot of regional innovation — France, Portugal, Germany, and Canada all come up repeatedly — and the writers are often borrowing from or responding to local traditions like concrete poetry, which makes me think more carefully about how digital literature isn’t just a “tech innovation,” but also an extension of older artistic experiments. I’d never heard of concepts like “videopoetry” before, but it makes a lot of sense in retrospect — poetry already experiments with form, and digital tools just expanded the palette. Same with the idea that Arabic visual poetry can be traced back to Mameluke-era calligraphic forms — there’s a continuity there, even if the technologies are completely different.

I noted the chapter’s admission that the division of content into geographical areas is somewhat artificial — but it’s also practical. There’s clearly a massive diversity in approaches and timeframes, and trying to treat “electronic literature” as a singular thing feels limiting. The fact that in some regions e-lit emerged through academic or literary institutions, while in others it was more underground or collaborative, also complicates the idea of a unified field.

Twine comes up near the end of the North America section, and it’s odd seeing something I’ve been working with mentioned as a kind of “second-generation” tool. It’s framed as part of the legacy of hypertext fiction, which helps contextualise the form a bit more for me — it’s not just a tool for building branching stories, it’s part of a longer debate about interactivity, non-linearity, and authorship. I hadn’t thought about it that way before.

The discussion of institutions like the ELO makes the field feel more established — but there’s also a recurring theme here about impermanence. So many early works are already lost, or require obsolete platforms to run. It’s a reminder that even though digital media feels current and accessible, it’s also inherently fragile. That might be worth keeping in mind for my own project — what happens to work built on something like Harlowe if the interpreter stops being supported?

I’m also starting to think more about collaborative authorship. The chapter highlights cases where programmers and writers worked together, but the labour wasn’t always equally acknowledged. It raises questions about where creative authority lies when the work depends so heavily on code, tools, or platforms someone else built. I’ve relied on prebuilt macros and CSS snippets, and it’s easy to forget how much of the final experience depends on decisions I didn’t make directly.

Overall, this gave me a lot of context and helped unsettle some assumptions I had going in. Electronic literature doesn’t have a clean or easily defined history — it’s full of competing timelines, localised innovations, and hybrid forms. That makes it harder to summarise, but more open, too. It feels like a space where experimentation isn’t just tolerated but expected, and that’s a useful frame for thinking about what I’m making now.


Adema, J. (2021). From Romantic to Posthumanist Authorship. In Living Books. MIT Press. https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/5179/chapter-standard/3409719/From-Romantic-to-Posthumanist-Authorship

The Adema reading really pushed me to think about how much the way I understand authorship is shaped by older, Romantic ideas like originality, individual genius and expression coming from some internal source. 

I’ve never actively subscribed to that mindset, but I still catch myself treating writing as something that comes from me, like a kind of personal output. What this piece made clear is how digital environments can be seen to complicate that, how the “me” doing the writing isn’t as stable or singular as I’d assumed. 

In digital spaces, writing passes through so many filters: code, interfaces, visual design, interactive structures. The idea of a lone author starts to feel more like a useful myth than a fact.

At first, I thought “posthumanist authorship” was going to be about AI writing or replacing the human, but it’s more about how writing becomes distributed across systems. 

That doesn’t mean authorship disappears—it just gets reframed. With my Twine project, for instance, the writing isn’t just in the text boxes I type—it’s in the structure of macros, the pacing created by timed animations, even in how the reader clicks and interacts. So much of what I’d normally think of as “style” is actually shaped by the medium.

The bit that stuck with me most was the discussion of infrastructure. I hadn’t thought of code or platforms as fragile before, but the idea that e-lit is difficult to preserve because it’s so tied to specific browsers or standards really hit home. It makes me wonder what happens to this work in a few years—if Harlowe changes or HTML support shifts, will it still run? What parts of it might vanish? That sense of impermanence isn’t just technical, it’s conceptual—it changes what it means to write at all.

There’s also something ethical in this reframing of authorship. If my work depends on tools and readers as much as it does on me, then I have a responsibility to think about the whole system, not just the text. It’s less about controlling meaning and more about creating conditions where meaning can happen—which feels a lot like curation, or orchestration. It's still creative, but in a very different register.


Hedley, J. (2024). Digital poesis impulse: A methodology of creative coding with GPT as co-pilot. TEXT, 28(1). https://doi.org/10.52086/001c.116921

Reading Jenny's work got me thinking about how digital writing involves more than just transforming text into new formats; it also involves adopting an entirely new way of thinking and doing things.

This gives the impression that digital poetry is something that is created by enacting your creative process rather than something that is fully planned out beforehand. 

The term “impulse” is doing a lot of work here. It captures this messy, intuitive part of the process where code, interface, and writer co-produce something that couldn’t have been arrived at by either alone.

The idea of working with GPT as a co-pilot chafes a bit since I’ve avoided it so vehemently until now. There’s a tension: I don’t really trust the output at all, but I also know I’m not really working alone. 

It’s interesting to think of coding and chatGPT not just as tools but as collaborators that might reshape the rhythm, direction, and even voice of a piece. 

Hedley makes space for that collaboration to be productive without pretending it’s frictionless. The glitches, the mismatches, the awkwardness of translation between human intention and machine logic—that’s part of the texture.

What also stood out to me was the refusal to settle into a polished, stable definition of methodology. Instead, Hedley foregrounds a process that’s live, ongoing, and sometimes contradictory. That felt honest. It gave me permission to think of my own Twine project not as a neat artifact but as a record of those same collisions between ideas, code, and interface. The phrase “poetics of broken code” stayed with me. There’s something powerful in embracing the unfinished, the unstable, not as failure but as form.


Jeremy Douglass. (2620). Enlightening Interactive Fiction :  Andrew Plotkin’s Shade. Electronic Book Review. http://electronicbookreview.com/essay/enlightening-interactive-fiction-andrew-plotkins-shade/

This reading felt like it took Shade apart narratively, technically, and psychologically. 
I played Shade before reading this, but I had to give it another try with this piece top of mind. Douglass really shows how the piece is doing more than just telling a story, it’s constructing a self through refusal, error messages, and constraint. 

That shift from “you can’t do that” to “you won’t do that” stuck with me. It’s like a character is being shaped on the spot. And by pushing against the limits, I’m not just exploring a room, I’m discovering how this person thinks, what they’re afraid of, what they’re avoiding.

The discussion of light mechanics in interactive fiction was unexpectedly fascinating. I hadn’t realised how much legacy design still shapes even the tools we use today, how something like “has light” is baked into authoring languages, even when the story (like in Shade) turns that logic on its head. That reversal, where light reveals death instead of safety—is one of the most effective uses of environmental storytelling I’ve seen in a digital work. It’s a great reminder that code and narrative aren’t separate layers, they work together to carry meaning.

I also found the breakdown of how the plane tickets are hidden really illuminating (no pun intended). That you can only find them after a certain number of searches isn’t just a gameplay trick, it reinforces the psychological logic of denial and delay. And unless you replay it, you might not even realise how manipulated your actions are. That tension between agency and constraint is basically the emotional core of the piece.

The last section, about the perspective shift from second person to this strange omniscient third, felt haunting. I hadn’t picked up on that before, but it reframes the entire thing as not just about death, but about self-erasure. You’re both watching and being buried. It’s unsettling, but brilliant. 

Shade uses every part of interactive fiction (form, parser, code) to make a point, and this reading helped me actually see that.


Motte, W. F. (1986). Introduction. In Warren F Motte translator. (Ed.), Oulipo : a primer of potential literature (pp. 1–22). University of Nebraska Press. https://rmit.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/view/delivery/61RMIT_INST/12268640080001341

This was a dense read, but one that started to bring some of the underlying tensions into focus—especially around what we call “literature” or “art” when we start working with digital media. Ricardo’s central question seems to be: what happens to those categories when the media themselves change so dramatically that they no longer obey the rules those categories were built for?

I appreciated the idea that traditional boundaries—like text versus image, or reader versus participant—start to break down in digital work, and that this isn’t just a surface-level convergence. He’s arguing that the logic of how meaning is made fundamentally shifts. You’re not just reading anymore; you also act, navigate, and co-produce. Furthermore, the work responds, changes, and behaves; it is not static.

The focus on two forms of experience—the underlying computational process and the visual surface—felt particularly pertinent to my own Twine project. The artistic or literary expression and the code that permits it are two layers that, according to Ricardo, can either reinforce one another or appear to be entirely unrelated. The delayed section reveals, the timed macros, and the typewriter effect all add to the story's feel in my instance, but they also rely on a hidden architecture that most readers won't notice. Nevertheless, it exists and shapes the experience.

I found the ontology section really interesting. While acknowledging something must qualify these works as "literary" or "aesthetic," Ricardo highlights this hesitancy to define any fundamental characteristics of digital literature. It got me thinking: what qualifies my project as literature? Is it the narrative structure? The presence of written language? Or the emotional resonance it aims for through interaction?

What stuck with me was the idea that we’re moving from thinking of a “work” as a static object to thinking of it as an action—something that performs, reacts, and exists in relationship with the reader. That really shifts how I think about authorship and design in this space. It’s not just about building something beautiful or clever—it’s about designing for a particular kind of encounter.


This reading is pretty tough so I came back to Chapter one later:

This reading really pushed me to think about what makes something digital literature, as opposed to just literature that happens to be online. Simanowski draws a pretty hard line: digital literature doesn’t just use digital tools—it has to be shaped by digital materiality. That includes time, interaction, code, images, sounds. A blinking word or a self-destructing passage isn’t just a flashy gimmick—it’s part of the meaning. That phrase “eventilized text” (from Hayles) stuck with me. It reframes the text as something happening, not just something written.

I found the examples involving reader interaction—especially the bomb and grenade scenes—really useful. They make explicit how digital works can blur the line between reader and participant, or even accomplice. Clicking a link can literally "kill" a character, and the system reacts to your action. You become part of the narrative logic. It made me think of Twine, again—how much of my story is shaped by when and how the reader clicks. But I hadn’t thought of that clicking as part of a hermeneutic act until now.

The final sections on presence vs. meaning helped contextualize some of the digital installations I’ve seen before but not really read. Simanowski and Ricardo argue that interactive art can seduce us into just experiencing without reflection, which sounds freeing but might short-circuit deeper understanding. The challenge is to still ask questions of the work—even (especially?) when it’s asking us to move or react instead of interpret. That’s probably the key takeaway for me: reading digital literature means reading what happens to the text, not just the words it contains.


Lori Emerson. (2014). Indistinguishable from Magic: Invisible Interfaces and Digital Literature as Demystifier. In Lori Emerson, Reading Writing Interfaces (pp. 1-). University of Minnesota Press. https://doi.org/10.5749/j.ctt6wr7dw.5

I’m now  thinking about how often I take digital interfaces for granted. Like, I use them constantly, but unless they don’t behave as I expect for whatever reason, I rarely stop to consider how much they actually shape what I write or how I think about writing. 

Emerson’s argument that modern interfaces have been designed to be invisible, that we’re supposed to forget they’re even there, really landed for me. I found the Apple stuff a bit ironic for me in particular, as I have no functional ability to use an Apple product. I hadn’t thought of the “it just works” ideology as being political or even ideological before, but it clearly is. It's designed to remove friction, sure, but also to remove awareness.

What I found most interesting is that Emerson isn’t just criticizing this “invisibility”, she’s pointing to the way some artists and writers, particularly in the electronic literature space, actively resist it. 

Some deliberately reveal the interface, foreground it, to make us conscious of the system behind their text. 

I hadn’t considered this possibility in my own work. With my Twine project, I’ve mostly focused on what the reader sees on the surface, the text, the typewriter animation, but now I’m wondering whether I should be drawing more attention to the underlying mechanics in place of the philosophical underpinnings of the narrative. And not just in an aesthetic way, but in a critical way.

It also reminded me of a kind of discomfort I’ve had working in Twine. Like, when something doesn't work right and I have to dig into the code, it suddenly feels like I’m not writing anymore, I’m “doing tech”, and I’ve had more than enough of that for one lifetime. 

But maybe that’s a false divide. Emerson suggests that this in-between space, the interface, is where a lot of the real writing is happening. That actually makes me feel better about the constant debugging. Maybe that friction is part of the work.

I’m starting to see that part of digital writing isn’t just putting words on a screen. It’s learning to write through the interface, and maybe even against it.


Aarseth, E. J. (1997). No Sense of an Ending: Hypertext Aesthetics. In Espen J. Aarseth 1965-, Cybertext : perspectives on ergodic literature (pp. 76–96). Johns Hopkins University Press. https://rmit.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/view/delivery/61RMIT_INST/12269642080001341

This helped me articulate something I’d felt about hypertext fiction but hadn’t been able to express properly, that being the way it resists closure.

He frames this idea of “no sense of an ending” not just as a structural quality of hypertext, but as something aesthetic and philosophical. In traditional literature, the ending is often where meaning is consolidated or revealed, but in hypertext, because the reader is choosing pathways, the idea of a unified or true meaning kind of falls apart.

I noticed this tension in my own Twine work since I’ve been instinctively building toward a “final passage,” trying to offer a sense of resolution. The idea that hypertexts intentionally avoid finales or decisive conclusions caused me to reconsider, that perhaps striving for a conventional conclusion is ineffective in this format.

Meaning is intrinsically subjective, so if the narrative branching is what shapes the reader's experience rather than where I select to guide the reader, the "end" may simply be wherever they choose to stop.

The bit about the tension between narrative desire (the drive to reach closure) and the game-like structure of hypertexts felt really relevant. It’s not just that hypertexts are fragmented, it’s that they generate this back-and-forth between wanting a coherent story and being confronted with nonlinear or recursive mechanics.

Aarseth doesn’t dismiss this as a flaw, though. He sees it as part of the aesthetic experience. That shift — from seeing fragmentation as a problem to seeing it as a form — is probably the most useful takeaway for me as a writer working in this space.


Sutton, D. (2008). Deleuze reframed : a guide for the arts student  (D. Martin-Jones, Ed.). I.B. Tauris.

I've read some Deleuze before, so I thought this might be interesting.
What is a Rhizome? helped me grasp Deleuze and Guattari’s concept not just as abstract theory but as a metaphorical tool for thinking differently. 

I was especially struck by the contrast between the tree and the rhizome, how the tree structure represents the dominant Western mode of thought: hierarchical, binary and causal. 
As humans and storytellers, we generally like to simplify complicated concepts into clear cause-and-effect narratives,  to link events or ideas to a single point of origin, i.e. temporality and causality.

In contrast, the rhizome provides an open, non-hierarchical concept of connectivity that has no real beginning or end.

The examples of paradigms which could be thought of through this lens, colonialism, guerilla networks, online activism, made the stakes seem very real. In particular, the orchid-wasp image demonstrated how power imbalances can arise even during mutual modifications. Because not every de-territorialization is liberating, it challenges the romanticism of rhizomatic thought.
I’m now thinking about how non-linear or interactive structures might make use of this rhizomatic logic, resisting traditional plot arcs and allowing readers to navigate their subjective meanings differently. It might open up new ways for me to write my Twine piece, or just to allow for readers to engage with it beyond how I intend.

Now I'm considering how the non-linear or interactive structures stemming from this rhizomatic logic may be enacted in my Twine piece, I could play with resisting traditional plot arcs and allow readers navigate meaning in unexpected ways and defy conventional plot arcs.


Montfort, N. (2004). Riddles. In Nick Montfort, Twisty little passages : an approach to interactive fiction (pp. 37–63). MIT Press. https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/rmit/reader.action?docID=5966542&ppg=54

I hadn’t thought about riddles as world-building before, but it makes a lot of sense. A riddle constructs its own miniature system of metaphor and rules, and the reader has to figure out how that system operates to make sense of it. That’s exactly what happens in interactive fiction: you’re not just reading or exploring a space—you’re trying to figure out how the rules of the world work so you can move forward.

What stood out to me most is the way this form positions the player (or reader, or interactor) as essential to the piece. The work doesn’t progress unless you solve something or respond in a way the system recognises as correct. That makes authorship and interpretation feel much more collaborative. It also adds pressure—if the writing or design isn’t “fair” (unclear hints, strange verbs, etc.), the whole thing collapses. The comparison to riddles really clarified that for me.

It’s also interesting how Montfort ties literary quality into that structure—not just that IF needs to be solvable, but that the writing, the order of clues, the tone, the rhythm, all matter. That poetic element—the idea that the solution should be satisfying both intellectually and aesthetically—is something I want to think more about in my own Twine work.


Astrid Ensslin. (2014). The Paradox of Poetic Gaming: evidence of everything exploding. In Astrid Ensslin, Literary Gaming (pp. 123-). The MIT Press.

Is it weird that what caught me first in this wasn’t the content, but the genre crisis?

These poetry games resist easy categorization, and Ensslin embraces that. I found myself bouncing between the urge to analyze the rhetoric of games and just play around with what she called the “Dionysian, paidiac” spirit of Jason Nelson’s evidence of everything exploding (EEE). That combination—the constant pull between rules and play, logic and absurdity—might be what makes EEE so compelling as both text and game.

Ensslin shows how poetic games, especially EEE, produce what she calls a “phenomenological paradox”: we’re expected to simultaneously play efficiently and read meaningfully. I think this is where the essay really resonated with my own interest in digital literature—as not just hybrid, but actually self-conflicted. The interface isn’t a neutral conduit, it’s a provocation. Nelson’s choice to overload the player with dense visual collage and fragmented literary references becomes a kind of anti-interface: deliberately janky, attention-scattering, hard to control. It made me think of Lori Emerson’s writing on invisible interfaces and how poetry games like EEE deliberately refuse to be smooth or seamless. There’s no illusion of immersion here—you’re constantly being knocked out of flow, which becomes part of the point.

I also appreciated the historical framing of art games as inheritors of Dada, Fluxus, Situationism. That helped me see how even if poetry games are “games,” they don’t submit to mainstream expectations of challenge and reward. In fact, EEE seems to troll those conventions, offering players “matchbook tales” as rewards—cut-scenes that are both nonsensical and disturbingly intimate. This felt like Nelson was not just parodying reward systems but twisting them into poetic performances in their own right.

The other thing that stood out was Ensslin’s placement of EEE on the L-L spectrum (Ludicity vs. Literariness). It’s fascinating that a game could occupy a similar ludic space to Arteroids and Silent Conversation, yet push so much harder into the literary. That seemed to confirm the idea that EEE wasn’t just a poetic game, but a game about poetry—a meta-text where the form continually reflects on itself.

I came away from this chapter thinking about how attention functions as a kind of currency in digital literature. EEE isn’t asking for one kind of attention—it’s asking for both, and asking us to fail at maintaining them. That failure is maybe what makes it poetic. The friction between modes of attention is not something to be resolved, but lived through—over multiple replays, in a kind of ludic, looping reflection.


Ikeda, R. (n.d.). Excavating Logics of White Supremacy in Electronic Literature: Antiracism as Infrastructural Critique. https://doi.org/10.7273/CCTW-4415

This one honestly threw me a bit. 

I’ve been thinking about electronic literature in terms of play, form, and experimentation, but this piece rerouted all of that. 

Ikeda reframes e-lit not just as aesthetic or formal innovation, but as something built on inherited infrastructure, systems that can replicate exclusion and reinforce racial hierarchies. I hadn't given any thought to how whiteness could be encoded by default into frameworks I would glance at an consider to be completely neutral.

Antiracism in electronic literature encompassing a broad range of authors and stories is what really resonated with me. The structures that determine what counts as literature in the first place and what gets preserved, who is seen as the intended reader or writer, should be challenged. 

The concept of “discriminatory design”, that digital systems often sort and sift according to racialized assumptions is not something I've ever had to consider for myself, but it is something I am aware of and think about in other areas of my life. If e-lit inherits those structures, then even work that seems progressive might be complicit.

Another thing I found compelling (and unsettling) is how he points to the whiteness of early electronic literature’s canon, not just in authorship but in the types of experimental works that were celebrated. I’d only tangentially considered who had the resources and access to make those works? Whose aesthetic values were being rewarded?

This reading made me realize that I need to think about its historical and infrastructural layers. Who’s being left out? Who’s being imagined? What does resistance look like when even the code or database might be working against you?

It’s a lot, but it feels essential. Ikeda’s call for antiracism as a practice of infrastructural excavation and redesign really expanded what I thought critique could be in this field.
